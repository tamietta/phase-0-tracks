    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
        - To designate or "mark up" a portion of content with semantics pertaning to the document's structure and organisation.
        - <p> and the heading tags will likely be the most ubiquitous. <div< will still have functionality for styling purposes, but HMTL5's new sectioning elements will mostly take its place for block-element semantic tags.

    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
        - Unless otherwise configured by CSS rules, the content within the <body> tags will be displayed in sequence from top to bottom.

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
        - I didn't know the built-in shorthand of < html + TAB > was itself a snippet. I also learnt that snippets can be generalised to any snippet of text, not just standard scripting outlines.

    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
        - There were quite a few. I think the idea and use of <meta< tags within the <head> is still hard to fully grasp. I think this will become clearer with time and experience. I did learn from my programming partner its importance in SEO. 
        - Fully understanding the Sublime Snippet was also quite challenging. I take longer to absorb technical details. I would feel securer knowing what <[CDATA[ ... ]]> does. However, in the end, the process of how to create a simple snippet is quite clear.
