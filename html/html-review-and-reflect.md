**Briefly describe your understanding of what the browser does, including definitions of the following:**

*   Browser
    -   A browser is a software application that enables access to the World Wide Web. It does so by retrieving, interpreting and sending data across the internet.
    
*   Client
    -  A client refers to a computer program whose primary functionality involves and is dependent upon requesting data from another computer program. A client is often used as a metonym for the device from which this request process originates. 

*   Server
    -   A server is a computer program which processes and handles requests made by a client's calling/request process. Servers act as counterparts to clients. A client requests and retrieves, whilst a server responds and delivers.

*   Render
    -   The process by which data retrieved from a server, is turned into a viewable webpage is known as rendering. A browser interprets information in an HTML file, and translates it into a format a human can understand.

**What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:**

*   HTML
    -   A language which specifies the semantic organisation of a web document. An HTML script acts as the architectural blueprint of a webpage. It categorises and assigns different parts of a webpage's data into their relative structural roles. A line of text can, for example, be designated as the header, the title of a paragraph, a URL link, or even the placeholder text of a form's input field via specifications in HTML.
    
*   Tag
    -   A tag is the notation used in HTML to "mark up" text with structural semantics. Tags predominantly come in pairs: a start tag and an end tag. Single tags, such as the `<img>` tag, are also possible.
    
*   Element
    -   An element refers to a particular structural feature of a document, e.g. a paragraph, an image, a side bar, etc. Elements are delimited by tags.

*   Node
    -   Nodes refer to the different textual or spatical units making up an HMTL document. The five main types of nodes are:
        1.  Document Node (the entire document)
        2.  Element Node (any HTML element)
        3.  Attribute Node (any defined attribute)
        4.  Textual Node (textual content belonging to an element)
        5.  Comment Node (comments in an HTML document)

*   Attribute
    -   An attribute is a property belonging to and describing an aspect of an element. Different elements can have different collections of attributes. The `name` attribute, for example, is used to set the identifier for an element.
       
*   Block Element
    - A block element defines a larger grouping of data in the body of an HTML document. Examples include `<p>`, the paragraph element, `<div>`, the division element, and `<section>`, the section element. All block elements must exist *within* the `<body>` tags. By default, block elements start on a new line.
     
*   Inline Element
    - An inline element are elements which can occur within a line of text. Unlike block elements, they do not occupy their own separate unit of space. An example would be the anchor element, `<a>`, which creates hyperinked text.   

**Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:**

*   `<head></head>`
    -   An element containing the metadata for rendering the information scripted in the body of the document. These include its title and links to referenced scripts, e.g. CSS style sheets.

*  `<body></body>`
    -   Defines the content of the webpage.
     
*   `<p></p>`
    -   Defines a paragraph of text.
    
*   `<form></form>`
    -   Defines a section for a form. Forms take the user's input data, and transmits it to the server.

*   `<div></div>`
    -   Defines a generic section of content. This element can be thought of as creating a division of content for any purpose.

*   `<span></span>`
    -   Defines a short portion of text. This can be equated to an inline version of `<div></div>`.
       
*   `<select></select>`
    -   Defines a drop-down box populated by `<option>` elements. Each `<option>` element represents a pre-defined choice.
     
*   `<h2></h2>`
    -   Defines a heading of secondary ranking. The headings hierarchy ranges from `<h1>`, the highest ranking, to `<h6>`, the lowest.
       
*   `<ol></ol>`
    -   Defines an unordered list.
    
*   `<ul></ul>`
    -   Defines an ordered list.

*   `<table></table>`
    -   Defines a table.
    
*   `<tr></tr>`
    -   Defines a row in a table.

*   `<td></td>`
    -   Defines a cell within a row of a table.
