### Reflections: Best Strategies For Time-Constrained Research

- Always start out any exploratory research with a very specific question. **Never** start any research **without a highly limited goal**.
    + **Example**
        * What is jQuery?
        * Why would you use it?
        * What are the most used methods?

- Be ***highly*** practical. Don't just explore **if you are under a time constraint**.

- Set up a **sample project**, and **create tasks** for yourself. Mimic a simple DBC release.
    + **Example Tasks**
        * How do you include jQuery into a HTML file? ... DONE
        * I want to change the heading. How do I change the heading with jQuery? ... DONE
        * I want to change the font of this text. How do I do that? ... DONE
        * I've created a <div> box. I want to animate it. What method do I use? ... DONE
        
- Before you begin research under a time constraint, **pre-plan**. Invest in:
    * Writing out questions.
    * Creating a sample project.
    * Crafting **tasks** to complete on that project. 

- Exploratory research for comprehensive knowledge can only be performed if you have abundant time.
